## ✨ About

**Learning is Radical** is a personal site and project hub built with **Vue 3** and **TailwindCSS**,
fully CDN-driven — no build tooling, no friction, no excuses.

It exists to showcase real work, living reflections, and experiments
at the edge of **software engineering**, **AI innovation**, and **socio-technical creativity**.

## 🔥 Features

- **🧩 Component-Based:** Modular Vue 3 structure (Navbar, Hero, About, Projects, Logs, Contact, Footer)
- **🎨 TailwindCSS Styling:** Custom dark theme with accent palette
- **⚡ Instant Deploy:** Fully static GitHub Pages deployment — no npm, no bundling
- **📈 Data-Driven Content:** Projects and Logs rendered dynamically from arrays (ready for external JSON later)
- **📱 Mobile-First:** Responsive, fast, and lightweight
- **🔮 Future-Proof:** Easily extensible into a full markdown blog or app launcher
